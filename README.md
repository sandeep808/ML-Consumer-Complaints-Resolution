# ML-Consumer-Complaints-Resolution

Consumer complaint resolution is important to any business. In this particular case we have been given detailed
consumer complaints along with whether consumer disputed with the conclusion. If we are able to predict this,
consumer who is more likely to dispute a conclusion can be given more attention as to how the complaints are
handled as well as how persuasively the final conlusions are conveyed to them.

About the data( [check this](https://cfpb.github.io/api/ccdb/fields.html) ).

The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to
companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the
consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository 
institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database. The database generally
updates daily.
